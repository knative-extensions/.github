This repository is for sharing org-wide Github metadata

The source of truth for this content is: https://github.com/knative-sandbox/.github,
which is mirrored to "downstream" `.github` repositories (e.g. `knative/.github`)
automatically on a [cron](/.github/workflows/sync.yaml).

The workflow template files have moved to [knobots](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/knobots).

```yaml
# This file is automagically synced here from github.com/knative-sandbox/.github
# repo by knobots: https://github.com/knative-sandbox/knobots and will be overwritten.
```
